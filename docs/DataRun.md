<center><h1>Analysis</h1></center>

Analysis section is a starting point, for a building query.  it is designed in such a way, that it retrieves the data in desired combinations as per your business needs and explores particular subject area it self. It also provides an ability on how to pull the data and how to modify the report and drill down deeper into the report for more insight.
 
**Let see in detail, How AcuBi helps you in retrieving the data as per your business needs :**
 
**1.** Click on **Analysis section** and select the desired **Project** and **Model** based on which the data is retrieved.

- To create a new Analysis report click on **Reset Visualization** ( refresh icon).

## Add Dimension and Measure

A **Dimension** is a group of data and **Measure** is information about group of data and they collectively acts as fundamental building blocks for a query.

> **For Instance:** **Name of the Employee** is defined as dimension and **Salary of the Employee** is defined as Measure.
 
 **To retrieve the data in analysis section follow the below steps,**
 
**2.**  Select one or more dimension fields ( Grey fields) to access the data. It supports strings and date types.

**3.** Select one or more measure fields (Orange fields) to access numeric values, such as Sum, Count, Max, Min and  Avg etc.

  > **Note :** To hide Explore /Visualize sections  click on  **angle double left** icon. To display the same click **angle double right  (»)** icon available above dimensions and measure field list.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## Filters 

Filters removes all the data except the one you want to retrieve. Filter expressions are the advanced way to limit the data. 

**The following are the various types of filter expressions used:**

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| String | For fields that contain letters or special characters |
|Numbers|For fields that contain numeric values|
|Date|For fields that contain dates|
|Lookup| To view the lookup in Report filters it should be derived first under lookup field, in model section|

## Hidden Filters

The data is retrieved based on hidden filters applied, this applied hidden filter fields are not visible in data section they are only visible under filter expression list.

**To carry out this function you can follow the following steps:**

**a.**  Apply hidden filters, to data fields in dimensions.
**b.** Fields to which hidden filters applied are visible in filter expression of filter section.
**c.** The data is retrieved, based on the applied hidden filters.

![
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sv18042016/fp1/603d0055942c97790066aa8195ad659038778ad2/images/hidden_filter.png)


- To add more filters click on **Add Rule**.
- To delete the filter applied Click **Ban Icon**.
- To hide the **Filter** or **Order** section Click on angle-double-up icon on to far right of the order section. To unhide click on angle-double-down icon at same location.

**5.**  Click on **Run** to display the data retrieved.

## Order  (Ascending / Descending)

To view the column data in ascending or descending orders, Click **Order** and choose the fields with desired combination, resulting on which the result in data section is displayed.

## Local Sorting

Local Sorting can be applied directly to the data obtained for dimension and measure fields in the data section. To enable this Click on the desired field header to enable sorting.

For **Dimensions**

- Click Upwards pointing arrow, to enable  ascending order.
- Click Downwards pointing arrow, to enable descending order.  

For **Measures**

- Click Upwards Pointing Arrow,  to enable descending order.
- Click Downwards Pointing Arrow, to enable ascending order.

## Query Time

**6.** Display total time taken to build the query of a report.

## Display number of rows

**7.** Display number of rows fetched while retrieving data.


## Display Totals

**8.**    On selecting  **check box** for totals, the report is displayed with total sum values of the measure fields obtained.


 ## Display  Row Limit

**9.**  You can limit the rows extracted to 100, 500, 1000, 5000, etc. By selecting the limit value to your desired number from drop down list.

## Pivot table

Multiple dimensions in the report data are often easier to look at, when you pivot one of the dimensions horizontally and display group based data for the field to which pivot is applied. 
To **Pivot** a dimension click on pivot for dimension before or after running the query.

> **Note :** you can add more pivots to other dimension fields but make sure you have at least one un-pivoted dimension and a measure value.

>**For instance,** To view number of orders received based on the month it displays in following way:

| Order Received  |year  |month|Region|Name|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|100 |2000|January|north|john|
|200|2001|February|south|Steve|
|300|2002 |march|east|Bob|
|400|2003|April|west|Mecker|

>On Applying pivot on month, it displays;
  
  |January|February|March|April|
  |--|--|--|--|
|100|200|300|400|
|2000|2001|2002|2003|
|North|south|east|west|
|john|Steve|bob|Mecker|

 **You can apply pivot to fields in 2 ways :**
 
**a.** Apply pivot **After Retrieving** the data by selecting the pivot in drop down of the field.
 
**b.** Apply pivot **Before Retrieving** the data while selecting the fields by clicking on pivot icon.

## Hide data in pivot 

To hide pivoted data 1st column in visualization, choose pivot hide first, to hide the last column choose pivot hide last in data section under datasets.


## Pin or Remove Pin

To freeze the column field values while scrolling the data from right or left, click **Pin** in field drop down provided and to release the same click **Remove Pin.**

## Multi-Level grouping

To carry out Multi-level grouping on extracted data. Select group option for the column fields in field drop down list. 

> **For instance** : In the below image grouping has been applied to 2 dimension fields Country Name and  State Name. In retrieved data on expanding country name it displays the perspective State Names that fall under specific country and on Further Expansion it displays city names that fall under the specific state  as shown in below image.

- **Label** labeling the calculated column.

- **Data type** data type used (string,number).

- **Field type** derives dimension or measure.

- **Calculation** derive arithmetical & logical expressions.
