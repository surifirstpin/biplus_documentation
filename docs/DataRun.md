Visualization access the data and allows you to perform data analysis with slice and dice of report information with pictorial representation.

## Selecting Fields from different mapped views

Under visualization section, Select the project and model for which you want to explore the data.

Visualisation sections contains Dimension and measures which acts as fundamental building blocks for a query.

**1.** Select the data fields from the list to create a visualisation.
**2.** Click on Run Button.

## Search option for getting fields

Views contain some set of fields, mostly dimensions and measures and they act as fundamental building blocks for Bi+ queries.
Dimensions are list of fields that can be used for applying filter options, for instance:
- An **Attribute**, which has a direct association to a column in an primary table.
- A **Numerical value**.
- A **Derived value,** computed based on the values of other fields in a single row.

> For example, Dimensions for "Customer" view includes customer name,customer phone number and customer email etc.

A measure is a list of fields that uses a SQL aggregate function, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN or MAX. any field that is counted based on the values is refereed as measure. Measures can be used to filter grouped values. 

>For example, measures for a “Amount” is Amount_sum, Amount_avg, Amount_min, Amount_max etc.

Using the search option provided in the visualization section you can select the fields for which you want to carryout the field values and apply filter options as shown in below image:

## Row Limitation and Runtime display

Using Bi+ you can limit the display of field values by using Limit option and check the Query runtime as shown in the image below;

## Filters (String , Integer and Date)

Filters is a optional list of filter expression applied to measure calculation,below are the available operations that can be applied for String , Integer and Date.

### String :
|                 Example                |                   Description                                                                                 |
