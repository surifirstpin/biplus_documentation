## Search option for getting fields

Views contain some set of fields, mostly dimensions and measures and they act as fundamental building blocks for Bi+ queries.
Dimensions are list of fields that can be used for applying filter options, for instance:
- An **attribute**, which has a direct association to a column in an primary table.
- A **numerical value**.
- A **derived value,** computed based on the values of other fields in a single row.

> For example, Dimensions for "Customer" view includes customer name,customer phone number and customer email etc.

A measure is a list of fields that uses a SQL aggregate function, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN or MAX. any field that is counted based on the values is refereed as measure. Measures can be used to filter grouped values. 

>For example, measures for a “Sales”
